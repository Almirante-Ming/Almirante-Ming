### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Almirante Ming, I'm studying development and systems analysis.

I am working on personal projects involving the concepts learned during the course, as well as developing solutions to personal problems, and in the future putting together for display.

I currently work doing computer maintenance and also migrating clients to the Workin PDV platform.

I'm still studying, but I'm applying projects involving SQL, Linux, Docker, Ruby, Python and JS.
